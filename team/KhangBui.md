My name is Khang Bui. I have decent experience in web development. I know Java, C/C++, Python, plus the topics that we have covered in class. I used to work on a project before that used Visual Studio Model View Controller, .NET framework and SQL Server and I found that it was a very useful platform to work with for web development. I am most comfortable with handling the backend of the program.
